### Origin story

Originally from a dull town in the North West of England, I've been fascinated by space since I can remember. After going to Senior Space School UK (three years in a row!), I did a GCSE in Astronomy on my own during the last four months of my final year of high school. Two years later, after my A-levels, I left for Scotland to do a degree in Astrophysics at the University of St Andrews!
​

During my degree I had two summer research projects: one in exoplanet atmospheres with Christiane Helling at St Andrews; the other in exoplanet detection, with Chas Beichman at Caltech.
Then, for my final year Masters project, I worked with Andrew Collier Cameron and Raphaëlle Haywood, studying starspot lifetimes from Kepler data.
​

I graduated in June 2015 with a first class masters degree (:raised_hands:) in Astrophysics, and shortly after moved to Geneva in Switzerland to start my PhD at the Observatoire de Genève. I continued my starspot work and was responsible for detecting exoplanet transits from K2, and organising the follow-up.

In June 2019 I successfully defended my thesis 'Know thy Star, Know thy Planet - Disentangling Planet Discovery & Stellar Activity'! :tada:
