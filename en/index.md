I'm an autistic :bar_chart: Data Science :chart_with_upwards_trend: consultant who honed her skills during her PhD in June 2019 at the Observatoire de Genève in Switzerland :switzerland:. I specialised in working with light curves from space-based telescopes :telescope:: I am a well-respected expert in the study of starspot :star2: photometric signatures; and have extensive experience in exoplanet detection and characterisation :earth_americas:.

Before turning to Data Science, I wrote 3 first-author publications :pencil: and contributed to 16 others, and have a h-index of 15. I've also refereed for AAS Journals, MNRAS and OPTICON proposals. I have consulted on four children’s non-fiction books on space and astronomy for Arcturus Publishing :books:.
