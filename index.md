I'm an Astronomer who got her PhD in June 2019 at the Observatoire de Gen√®ve, Switzerland. I specialise in working with light curves from space-based telescopes. I am a well-respected expert in the study of starspot photometric signals, and have extensive experience in exoplanet detection and characterisation.

You can find details of my research and experience on these pages and can currently contact me via Twitter or LinkedIn.

I also have a blog where I plan to ramble about my life and experiences -- read if you dare... :flushed:
