I'm an autistic Astronomer who got her PhD in June 2019 at the Observatoire de Gen√®ve in Switzerland :switzerland:. I specialise in working with light curves from space-based telescopes :telescope:: I am a well-respected expert in the study of starspot :star2: photometric signatures; and have extensive experience in exoplanet detection and characterisation :earth_americas:.

You can find details of my research and experience on my [Research]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/) pages, download my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/CV/) and can contact me with the [Contact Form]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/).

I also have a blog where I plan to ramble on about my life and experiences -- read if you dare! :flushed:
