Our knowledge of spots on the Sun (known as sunspots) is very good, especially when compared to our knowledge of the same phenomena on other stars. This is because we can easily make out features on the solar surface and study them, but we can't easily resolve stellar surfaces (unless they have quite extreme surface features). So, if we want to know something about starspots then we need to extrapolate that information from other sources!

Collaborators and I have successfully determined the lifetimes of starspots using Kepler mission light curves for a sample of 2000+ stars. We also determined how they changed given the kind of stellar spectral type. This work has also been used for other scenarios, measuring the starspot lifetime for individual stars, where this knowledge can significantly inform further studies.
