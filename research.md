### Research

My areas of research cover both sides of the coin when it comes to exoplanets and their host stars.

## Stellar Activity
I have extensive experience in studying the effect of starspots in photometric light curves from space-based telescopes. To learn more, see [Starspots]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/starspots).

## Exoplanet Detection
During my time in Geneva, I was responsible for the detection of hot- and warm-Jupiters from the K2 mission, the follow on mission of the Kepler space-based telescope. Find out more under [Exoplanet Detection]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/exoplanet-detection).
