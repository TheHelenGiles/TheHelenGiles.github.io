In Geneva, as a CHEOPS PhD candidate, I designed and ran the search for hot- and warm-Jupiters in the publicly released data from the K2 mission. I was then responsible for initiating radial velocity follow-up of the best candidates using the Swiss-Euler telescope at La Silla, Chile. This was done in collaboration with the whole Exoplanet group in Geneva as well as other groups around Europe, the USA and Chile. This resulted in two planet discoveries, K2-140 b and K2-311 b, as primary author.

Furthermore, prior to my PhD, in 2014 I went to Caltech for a summer project at the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI). I searched for previously undiscovered transits of exoplanets in Kepler data. Because the automated detection software required exoplanet candidates to transit a minimum of three times in a light curve, I searched for transits which only appeared once or twice. I discovered a long-period (2.8 years) Saturn-sized planet discovery and, after receiving follow-up radial velocity observations, it was published a few years later as Kepler-1654 b.
